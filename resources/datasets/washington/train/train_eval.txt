train/271-05.png You are hereby ordered to repair to
train/271-06.png Captain Hogg's Company at Fort Dinwiddie
train/271-07.png with eight good men: as that Company is
train/271-08.png without a Surgeon, if you will do that duty, an
train/271-09.png allowance will be made you for it. You are
train/271-10.png to provide medicines, Vc. upon the best terms
train/271-11.png you can. This Order I expect will be immedi-
train/271-12.png ately complied with; and that no Delays be of-

train/271-29.png list by the 1st. of December. Your late disobedi-
train/271-30.png ence of Orders has greatly displeased me. It is
train/271-31.png impossible to carry on affairs as they ought to be,
train/271-32.png when you pay so little regard to the Force of a
train/271-33.png Military Order - You must be conscious within
train/271-34.png yourself (or at least ought to be) that your Crime
train/271-35.png is sufficient to Break the best Officer that ever
train/271-36.png bore a Commission.

train/272-11.png ordered to halt here, where he now remains
train/272-12.png unfit for Duty: therefore I have sent
train/272-13.png in his room. Sergeant Wilper has received

train/272-15.png Arms and Clothing to complete your Compa-
train/272-16.png ny to the Establishment. He has enlisted

train/272-20.png take care of your Company; for which he
train/272-21.png will be allowed. You must use your best

train/272-23.png with it as you see most needful :- It is impossi-
train/272-24.png ble I can direct about it at this distance,
train/272-25.png properly. As we have contracted for a
train/272-26.png large quantity of Beef already, you are
train/272-27.png desired to engage no more than what will
train/272-28.png suffice for your own Company. I shall
train/272-29.png see that money is lodged with Mr. Dick
train/272-30.png for your use when I see him. You are to

train/273-15.png desired not to plan any work, which requires much

train/274-16.png ing to the Country, can be had here, one
train/274-17.png of the Country Teams must be stopped,
train/274-18.png and the horses given to him. You must
train/274-19.png engage the herdsmen to remain with
train/274-20.png the Cattle, until they hear from the Com-
train/274-21.png missary or from me. You must engage
train/274-22.png all the Coopers you can to make Barrels
train/274-23.png for packing the Beef; and if any of the
train/274-24.png Soldiers are Coopers, they must be set im-

train/275-07.png gets; and if there are any who are remarkably
train/275-08.png awkward, particular pains must be taken with

train/300-23.png informing me that all was peaceable
train/300-24.png above, and that nothing was so imme-
train/300-25.png diately wanting as Salt. I got what I
train/300-26.png could at that place, and hastened on
train/300-27.png here to engage more; - to receive the Recruits
train/300-28.png that were expected in; and to wait the ar-

train/301-05.png lays may not prove ominous. In that case, I
train/301-06.png shall not know how to act; for I can never
train/301-07.png submit to the command of Captain Dag-
train/301-08.png morthy, since you have honoured me with
train/301-09.png the Command of the Virginia Regiment,
train/301-10.png Vc. The Country has sustained inconceivable
train/301-11.png losses by delaying the Commissaries at Williamsburgh:
train/301-12.png many of the Carolina Beeves are dead, through ab-
train/301-13.png solute poverty; and the chief part of them too poor
train/301-14.png to slaughter. We are at a loss how to act, for want
train/301-15.png of the mutiny Bill; and should be obliged to
train/301-16.png your Honour to have fifty or an hundred printed,
train/301-17.png and sent by the Bearer. There is a clause in
train/301-18.png that Bill, which if you are not kind enough
train/301-19.png to obviate, will prevent entirely the good inten-
train/301-20.png tion of it: i.e. delaying the execution of Sen-

train/301-22.png quainted with the proceedings of the Court.
train/301-23.png This, at times when there is the great-
train/301-24.png est occasion for Expamples, will be morally im-
train/301-25.png possible (I mean while we are on our march;
train/301-26.png perhaps near the Ohio) when none but strong par-
train/301-27.png ties can pass with safety: at all times it must be
train/301-28.png attended with great expence, trouble and inconve-
train/301-29.png niency. this I represented to Colonel Corbin and
train/301-30.png some other Gentlemen of the Council, when I
train/301-31.png was down; who said that that objection to
train/301-32.png the Bill would be removed, by your Hon-
train/301-33.png ours giving Blank Warrants, to be filled up
train/301-34.png as occasion should require. This would effec-
train/301-35.png tually remedy all those Evils, and put things
train/301-36.png in their proper channel.
train/301-37.png We suffer greatly for want of Ket-
train/302-01.png 302. Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755.
train/302-03.png Kettles: those sent from below being Tin, are of
train/302-04.png small duration. We shall also in a little time,
train/302-05.png suffer as much for want of Clothing; none
train/302-06.png can be got in these parts: those which Major
train/302-07.png Carlyle and Dalton contracted to furnish,
train/302-08.png we are disappointed off. Shoes and Stockings
train/302-09.png we have, and can get more if wanted, but
train/302-10.png nothing else. I should be glad your Honor
train/302-11.png would direct what is to be done in these ca-
train/302-12.png ses; and that you would be kind enough to
train/302-13.png desire the Treasurer to send some part of the
train/302-14.png money in gold and silver: were this done, we
train/302-15.png might often get necessaries for the Regiment
train/302-16.png in Maryland or Pennsylvania, when they
train/302-17.png can not be had here. but with our money
train/302-18.png it is is impossible; our paper not passing there.
train/302-19.png The recruiting Service goes on ex-
train/302-20.png tremely slow. Yesterday being a day appointed
train/302-21.png for Rendezvousing at this place, there came in
train/302-22.png ten Officers with twenty men only. If I had
train/302-23.png any other than paper money, and you appro-
train/302-24.png ved of it; I would send to Pennsylvania
train/302-25.png and the Borders of Carolina: I am confident,
train/302-26.png men might be had there. Your Honor
train/302-27.png never having given any particular Directi-
train/302-28.png ons about the Provisions; I should be glad to
train/302-29.png know, whether you would have more laid in
train/302-30.png than what will serve for twelve hundred men;
train/302-31.png that I may give orders accordingly.
train/302-32.png As I can not now conceive, that
train/302-33.png any great danger can be apprehended at
train/302-34.png Fort Cumberland this Winter; I am sensible,
train/302-35.png that my constant attendance there, can not

train/303-04.png be so serviceable as riding from place making the
train/303-05.png proper Dispositions, and seeing that all our neces-
train/303-06.png saries are forwarded up with dispatch. I there-
train/303-07.png fore think it advisable to inform your Honour
train/303-08.png of it, hoping that it will correspond with your own opinion.
train/303-09.png I forgot to mention when I was down, that Mr. Living-
train/303-10.png ston, the Fort - Major, was appointed adjutant to our
train/303-11.png Regiment: - I knew of none else whose long servitude
train/303-12.png in a military way, had qualified better for the office,
train/303-13.png he was appointed the 17th. of September.
train/303-14.png Captain Mercer's pay, as aid de camp,
train/303-15.png seems yet doubtful; I should be glad if your Honour
train/303-16.png would fix it: so is Captain Stewarts: If Captain Stew-
train/303-17.png arts is encreased, I suppose all the Officers belonging
train/303-18.png to the Light Horse will expect to have theirs augmen-
train/303-19.png ted also. Colonel Stephens, in a late letter, dis-
train/303-20.png covered an inclination to go to the Creek and Che-
train/303-21.png rokee Indians this Winter. I told him where to ap-
train/303-22.png ply, if he had any such thoughts. I believe, on
train/303-23.png so useful a Business, he might be spared until
train/303-24.png the Spring. If your Honor think proper to or-
train/303-25.png der the Act of Assembly for apprehending Deser-
train/303-26.png ters, and against harbouring them, to be published
train/303-27.png every Sunday in each parish Church, until the
train/303-28.png people were made acquainted with the Law, it would
train/303-29.png have a very good effect. The Commonalty in gene-
train/303-30.png ral, or more through ignorance than design: few
train/303-31.png of them are acquainted that such a Law exists: and
train/303-32.png there is no other certain way of bringing it to their
train/303-33.png knowledge. There are a great many of the men
train/303-34.png that did once belong to our Companies, deserted
train/303-35.png from the Regiments into which they were draugh-
train/303-36.png ted, that would now gladly return if they could

train/304-03.png be sure of idemnity. If your Honor would
train/304-04.png be kind enough to intimate this to General
train/304-05.png Shirley, or the Colonels of those Regiments, - it
train/304-06.png would be of service to us: without leave we
train/304-07.png dare not receive them. Vc.

train/304-12.png The Bearer, captain John Mercer,
train/304-13.png having leave to go down and Settle his ac-
train/304-14.png compts with the Committee; is ordered to
train/304-15.png call upon you for the balance of the ten
train/304-16.png thousand pounds, which I believe we shall
train/304-17.png want before another opportunity may offer;
train/304-18.png this being the time when our Demands for
train/304-19.png money are greatest. When I left Willi-
train/304-20.png amsburgh, I intended to proceed to Winches-
train/304-21.png ter; but meeting with Letters at Fredericks-
train/304-22.png burgh, informing me that peace prevailed
train/304-23.png above, and that nothing was immediate-
train/304-24.png ly wanted but Salt; I came up here to en-
train/304-25.png gage what I could, and to wait the arrival
train/304-26.png of some Recruits at this place; and a Vessel
train/304-27.png with sundry arms, Vc. for the Troops. This Ves-
train/304-28.png sel left Williamsburgh two days after I did,
train/304-29.png and is not yet arrived: neither is the Ex-
train/304-30.png press returned, which the Governor sent to
train/304-31.png General Shirley for Commissions for the
train/304-32.png Field Officers of our Regiment: which gives
train/304-33.png me much concern; fearing that this de-
train/304-34.png lay is ominous. In that case, I shall not
train/304-35.png know how to act; - it will be useless for me

train/305-08.png We shall suffer very greatly in a little
train/305-09.png time, for want of Clothing for the Soldiers; and none
train/305-10.png can be had here, nor in short, I believe in the
train/305-11.png Country. Those which Carlyle and Dalton con-
train/305-12.png tracted to furnish, we are disappointed in; and
train/305-13.png they say, they have searched all the Stores in
train/305-14.png Maryland, as well as this part of Virginia, and
train/305-15.png none are able to furnish Clothes. We have
train/305-16.png sustained inconceivable losses by the commis-
train/305-17.png saries delays: many of the Carolina Beeves
train/305-18.png are dead, through poverty and bad manage-
